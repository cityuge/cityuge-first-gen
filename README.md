# CityU GE Guide (Old Version)

This is the old version of the [CityU GE Guide website](https://cityuge.com/)
built with [Laravel 4.1](http://laravel.com).

Since Laravel 4.1 is an outdated version of the framework, it is not recommended to use the code in production
environment.
If you still want to run the web application, you need to replace all the `***REMOVED***` strings by the correct values
to run the app successfully.

The source code does not include the data stored in the database.
However, database schema is preserved in Laravel database migrations.

## Requirements

- Apache
- PHP 5.4+
- MariaDB or MySQL
- Grunt for compiling and minifying LESS and JavaScript
